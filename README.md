## Features
- Displays the number of days remaining until Christmas.
- Updates dynamically every time the page is loaded.

## Code Explanation
The main functionality of the countdown is encapsulated within the `renderCountdown` function. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:


```javascript
const countdownDisplay = document.getElementById("countdown-display")

function renderCountdown(){
    const christmas = 25; // Sets the Christmas date.
    const today = new Date(); // Gets today's date.
    const todayDate = today.getDate(); // Extracts the day of the month.
    const remainingDays = christmas - todayDate; // Calculates the days left until Christmas.
    countdownDisplay.textContent = remainingDays; // Displays the remaining days.
}

renderCountdown();
```

## Code Elements Explained
- `document.getElementById("countdown-display")`: Selects the HTML element to display the countdown.
- `new Date()`: Retrieves the current date.
- `getDate()`: Extracts the day of the month from today's date.
- `textContent`: Used instead of `innerText` for performance and to avoid any potential security issues with HTML content.

## Stretch Goals

In addition to the main functionality, the project also includes several stretch goals that have been implemented to enhance the application:

- **Display Hours, Minutes, Seconds**: Beyond just showing the days remaining, the application now displays the exact time left including hours, minutes, and seconds, which updates every second for a real-time countdown.

- **Auto-Updating Countdown**: The countdown automatically updates the display every second, showing the precise time until Christmas without the need to refresh the page.

- **Styling for Festivity**: The application features festive styling with a radial gradient background that smoothly transitions into a charming Christmas village scene, providing a visually pleasing and thematic user experience.

Here's a snippet of the code that accomplishes these stretch goals:

```javascript

const countdownDisplay = document.getElementById('countdown-display')

function renderCountdown() {
    const now = new Date();
    const currentYear = now.getFullYear();
    const christmas = new Date(currentYear, 11, 25);
    if (now > christmas) {
        christmas.setFullYear(currentYear + 1);
    }

    const totalSeconds = Math.floor((christmas - now) / 1000);
    const days = Math.floor(totalSeconds / (3600 * 24));
    const hours = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 3600) % 24;
    const minutes = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 60) % 60;
    const seconds = totalSeconds % 60;

    countdownDisplay.textContent = `${days}d ${hours}h ${minutes}m ${seconds}s until Christmas!`;
}

// Update the countdown every second
setInterval(renderCountdown, 1000);
```

This function renderCountdown is called every second using setInterval, ensuring the countdown is always current down to the last second.
